# The Journey of Java - A language brewer's perspective

### Details about commits

1. The [initial commit](https://github.com/pushkarnk/polyglot-meetup/commit/53b8c1ae4de5f732e3c88c5f11562df3e8e28d27) has vanilla Java code that will compile with Java 1.1 to 1.4.

2. Generics were added in Java 5. [This commit](https://github.com/pushkarnk/polyglot-meetup/commit/fb99825793a21b4788e5567ccfcbe3af2d39d089) shows how generics made the Collections framework mature and easy to use.

3. [Auto-boxing and auto-unboxing](https://github.com/pushkarnk/polyglot-meetup/commit/b07f2588dd823865f4211a034db5aafb07f61047), also introduced in Java 5, was another syntactic sugar. 

4. Java 5 also added [enums](https://github.com/pushkarnk/polyglot-meetup/commit/1186ed53647e048b4cb7a0b6a8c88aa728d04bf4) - that offered a better way of representing a fixed set of constant values. 

5. More syntactic sugar introduced in Java 5 - [enhanced for loops](https://github.com/pushkarnk/polyglot-meetup/commit/f511cbdc7479bc2d224c60008f521e666cced8fb), more like iterators.

6. The [diamond operator](https://github.com/pushkarnk/polyglot-meetup/commit/bd72c93e7a2d2e884f5e89d2c22b451156a18c49), introduced in Java 7, offered better type inference for Generics.

7. Starting from Java 7, you could also [catch multiple exeptions](https://github.com/pushkarnk/polyglot-meetup/commit/c5e4eb99992f2e5980d70723996d0082690649ff) in a single catch block and have [switch statements on strings](https://github.com/pushkarnk/polyglot-meetup/commit/c7293c5a643762acb897f9208f5d04e8fea2dc2d).

8. Java 8 did a paradigm shift by introducing the much awaited lambdas. The first use of lambdas could be [replacing small anonymous classes (with a single method) with a lambda expression](https://github.com/pushkarnk/polyglot-meetup/commit/ca0f53cc412b96c78f02e16b3bee585f0e3d44ca).

9. Functional programming typically does away with the need to have loops. Loops are abstracted by the language or standard libraries features. Java 8 streams open up a plethora of possibilities. See how [this commit](https://github.com/pushkarnk/polyglot-meetup/commit/ce40b19430fa9fb2da88889f59b904dde8b82a18) and [this commit](https://github.com/pushkarnk/polyglot-meetup/commit/ded299d752d29ce443a7751756e0af686fec27f7) bring about a huge shift in the code, making it more readable and concise.
